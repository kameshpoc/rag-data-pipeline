# This Dockerfile defines a container image that will serve as both SDK container image
# (launch environment) and the base image for Dataflow Flex Template (launch environment).

# This Dockerfile illustrates how to use a custom base image when building
# a custom contaier images for Dataflow. A 'slim' base image is smaller in size,
# but does not include some preinstalled libraries, like google-cloud-debugger.
# To use a standard image, use apache/beam_python3.11_sdk:2.54.0 instead.
# Use consistent versions of Python interpreter in the project.
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Copy SDK entrypoint binary from Apache Beam image, which makes it possible to
# use the image as SDK container image. If you explicitly depend on
# apache-beam in setup.py, use the same version of Beam in both files.
COPY --from=apache/beam_python3.11_sdk:2.60.0 /opt/apache/beam /opt/apache/beam

# Copy Flex Template launcher binary from the launcher image, which makes it
# possible to use the image as a Flex Template base image.

# Because this image will be used as custom sdk container image, and it already
# installs the dependencies from the requirements.txt, we can omit
# the FLEX_TEMPLATE_PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS_FILE directive here
# to reduce pipeline submission time.
# Similarly, since we already installed the pipeline package,
# we don't have to specify the FLEX_TEMPLATE_PYTHON_SETUP_FILE="${WORKDIR}/setup.py" configuration option.

# Optionally, verify that dependencies are not conflicting.
# A conflict may or may not be significant for your pipeline.

# Optionally, list all installed dependencies.
# The output can be used to seed requirements.txt for reproducible builds.

# to be used as an SDK container image.
